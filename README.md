# Fortnite-BuildSwapper-AHK
An AutoHotkey script for Fortnite that lets you hold one build key while temporarily switching to another with a single press. When you release the most recent key, it automatically returns to your original build. Designed for smoother building using mouse side buttons mapped as keyboard inputs.
